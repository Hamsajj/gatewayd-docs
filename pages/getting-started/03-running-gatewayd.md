# Running GatewayD

These are the steps to make GatewayD work for you:

1. Start the PostgreSQL database.
2. Start the Redis database for caching query results.
3. Install GatewayD and the cache plugin.
4. Configure and start GatewayD.
5. Test your setup with [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) or any other PostgreSQL client or driver.
6. Clean up.

**üóíÔ∏è Note**
For demo purposes, we'll use Docker to start the databases. Also, you can skip step one if you already have a database up and running.

## 1. Start your PostgreSQL database

Use the following command to start a PostgreSQL database server inside a container:

```bash
docker run --rm --name postgres-test -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
```

Test you database by running the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it postgres-test psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres -c "\d"
```

Since the database is just created, no relations exist.

## 2. Start your Redis database

Use the following command to start a Redis server inside a container:

```bash
docker run --rm --name redis-test -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

You can verify if both of the above worked correctly by running `docker ps`.

## 3. Install GatewayD and the cache plugin

Download and extract GatewayD and the cache plugin using the following commands:

```bash
mkdir gatewayd && cd gatewayd
wget https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/releases/download/v0.6.0/gatewayd-linux-amd64-v0.6.0.tar.gz
tar xf gatewayd-linux-amd64-v0.6.0.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd-plugin-cache/releases/download/v0.1.7/gatewayd-plugin-cache-linux-amd64-v0.1.7.tar.gz
tar xf gatewayd-plugin-cache-linux-amd64-v0.1.7.tar.gz
```

## 4. Configure and start GatewayD

Open the `gatewayd_plugins.yaml` file with your favorite editor and change the `localPath` to `./gatewayd-plugin-cache`. Also, replace the checksum to the one provided in the `checksum.txt` file. You can verify the checksum by running the following command:

```bash
sha256sum gatewayd-plugin-cache -c checksum.txt
```

**üóíÔ∏è Note**
If you want to see the details of what is happening behind the scenes, open the `gatewayd.io` and set the default logger's level to `debug` or `trace`.

Run the following command to start GatewayD:

```bash
./gatewayd run
```

Running GatewayD will produce this log output, which means that GatewayD is started and is:

1. listening on port `15432` with 10 connections to postgres in the pool.
2. running the `gatewayd-plugin-cache`.
3. having the pid `41568`.
4. exposing aggregated Prometheus metrics on `http://localhost:2112/`.
5. exposing an HTTP and a gRPC API on ports `18080` and `19090`.

```

## 5. Test you setup with `psql`

GatewayD is running on the host, while PostgreSQL is running inside a container. So, you need to run the following command to test it. Notice that `172.17.0.1` is the IP address of the host machine.

```bash
docker exec -it postgres-test psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@172.17.0.1:15432/postgres
```

Now you can create a table and insert data into it. Selecting the data will trigger the cache plugin to store the results in Redis and subsequent SELECT queries will be served from the cache. The moment you insert a new value into the table or update a row, all the cached values from that table will be invalidated.

```
postgres=# create table test (id int);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into test values (1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into test values (1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into test values (1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from test; -- This is read from the database.
 id
----
  1
  1
  1
(3 rows)

postgres=# select * from test; -- This is read from the cache.
 id
----
  1
  1
  1
(3 rows)
```

You can check the cached keys using the following command and it should contain three keys.

```bash
docker exec -it redis-test redis-cli dbsize
```

Now, insert a new row into the `test` table:

```
postgres=# insert into test values (1); -- The cache is invalidated.
INSERT 0 1
```

Now, check the total number of keys again, and you'll see that there is only a single key, which means that the cached values are gone.

## 6. Clean up

You can clean up all of the above by following these steps:

1. Exit `psql` by typing `Ctrl+D` or `\q` and hitting `Enter`.
2. Stop `gatewayd` gracefully by typing `Ctrl+C`.
3. Stop the container by running `docker stop postgres-test redis-test`. The continers will be removed automatically.
