# Installation

We release binaries for Linux and macOS.

Support for [packages for different distribution](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/issues/136) and the [Docker image](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/issues/137) is in the works.

## Download the GatewayD binary

The GatewayD [repository](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd) on GitHub contains all the [releases](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/releases) as a standalone binaries for Linux and macOS platforms. from which you can download and extract the archive for your platform. After that, you can place the `gatewayd` binary in your `PATH` to run it from any location. The archive file also contains configurations files for GatewayD and plugins, which are named `gatewayd.yaml` and `gatewayd_plugins.yaml` respectively.

## Using GatewayD plugins

If you want to use any GatewayD plugin, you need download, extract and place it in your desired location accessible to GatewayD.

**ðŸš§ WIP**
A [`plugin` subcommand](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/issues/122) is in the works to simplify installation and management of plugins and their configurations.
